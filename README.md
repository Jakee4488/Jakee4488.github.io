🚀 Project Portfolio
💬🤖 Context-Aware Chatbot Using RAG Framework: My dissertation project, creating a context-aware chatbot using state-of-the-art LLMs (like GPT and Llama2) and a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework.

🛠️🔄 End-to-end MLOps with Databricks: This repository provides a simple, end-to-end MLOps architecture implemented within the Databricks platform. It includes a minimal, working machine learning project that demonstrates the key stages of an MLOps lifecycle, including data preparation, model training and tracking (using MLflow), model registration, and batch inference or serving.

🌿🔬 CNN for Plant Disease Classification: A comparative analysis of various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to evaluate performance in detecting and classifying plant diseases.

🍄💻 Mushroom Classification Analysis: 🍄Mushroom Classification with MLOps. This repository contains a complete Python solution for classifying mushrooms as edible or poisonous using various Machine Learning algorithms. More importantly, it demonstrates how to transform an experimental ML model into a reliable, production-ready system through the adoption of MLOps principles.

🕸️📊 GraphRag-Neo4j_llama3.1: GraphRag-Neo4j_llama3.1 is an implementation of Graph RAG using Neo4j and llama_3.1. This project aims to leverage the power of graph databases and machine learning for advanced relational data processing and analysis.
